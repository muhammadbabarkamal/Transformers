# Binary-View Transformers
This reprository contains Speech recogination models which includes 
preprocessing of Audio files, 
Convertion of Audio into image by using Mel-spectrogram,
CNN based detection,
RNN/LSTM based detection,
attention modules,
Transformers,
Binary-view Transformer (Dervived from study of human lestning and perception of speech through binary listening through Ears and Multi-attention utilization),
Inceptionnet,
Mobilenet, 
This project was part of my research that i have done in MS(computer Science) where i configure Artifical Intellegence Based Algorithms to Recoginise Speech.
